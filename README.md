# Eric Lewis Portfolio

## Description

I made this website to be a portfolio for all of my fullstack dev work through my career. It will be used to show potential future employers my capabilities and allow them to observe a body of my work. I learned quite a lot about how to use flexbox making this and I will continue to improve upon it as I learn more.

## Usage

This application can be used to browse an constantly updating library of my best works in developement and can be used as a template for people to make thier own portfolios.
